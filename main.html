            <p>This is Peivend Ghayori's portfolio. I am a filmmaker who's studied screenwriting and film-production and at the moment I am teaching msyelf how to program and code. I hope this portfolio will give you an idea of how far I've come in my programming journey. Feel free to click on the projects, although, I haven't really made anything yet, I hope to fill this page with projects from my Codecademy-course and beyond.</p>
